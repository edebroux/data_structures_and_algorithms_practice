    "### String notations and concepts\n",
    "Strings are basicallly a sequence of objects, mainly a sequence of characters. As with any other data type, such as an `int` or `float`, we need to store the data and operations that have to be applied to them. String data types allow us to store the data, and Python provides a rich set of operations and functions that can be applied to the data of the string type. Most of the operations and functions provided by Python that can be applied to the strings were described in Chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are mainly textual data that is generally handled very efficiently. The following is an example of a string:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\"packt publishing\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "A substring is also a sequence of characters that is part of the given string. For example, `\"packt\"` is a substring for the string `\"packt publishing\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence is a sequence of characters that can be obtained from the given string by removing some of the characters from the string but by keeping the order of occurrence of the characters. For example, `\"pct publishing\"` is a valid subsequence for the string `\"packt pblishing\"` that is obtained by removing the characters a, k, and u. However, this is not a substring. A subsequence is different from a substring, since it can be considered as a generalization of substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prefix of a string, `s`, is the substring of `s` in that it is present in the starting of the string. There is also another string, `u`, that exists in the string `s` after the prefix. For example, the substring `\"pack\"` is a prefix for the string `s = \"packt publishing\"` as it is starting the substring and there is another substring after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suffix `d` is a substring that is present at the end of the string `s` so that there is another nonempty substring existing before substring `d`.  For example, the substring `\"shing\"` is the suffix for the string `\"packt publishing\"`. Python has built-in functions to check whether a string has a given prefix or suffix as shown in the code snippet:"

    "### Pattern matching algorithms\n",
    "A pattern matching algorithm is used to determine the index positions where a given pattern string is matched in a text string. It returns `\"pattern not found\"` if the pattern does not match in the text string. For example, for the given string `s = \"packt publisher\"`, and the pattern `p = \"publisher\"`, the pattern matching algorithm returns the index position where the pattern is matched in the text string.\n",

    "The brute-force algorithm, or naive approach for the pattern matching algorithm, is very basic. Using this, we simply test all the possible combinations of the input pattern in the given string to find the position of occurrence of the pattern. This algorithm is very naive and is not suitable if the text is very long.\n",

We continue comparing the pattern and text string by shifting the pattern by one index position.\n",

Thus, worst-case time complexity would be $\\mathcal{O}(m*(n-m+1))$.\n",
    "### Rabin-Karp algorithm\n",
    "The Rabin-Karp pattern matching algorithm is an improved version of the brute-force approach for finding the location of a given pattern in a text string. The performance of the Rabin-Karp algorithm is improved by reducing the number of comparisons with the help of hashing. The hashing function returns a unique numeric value for a given string. The algorithm is faster than the brute-force approach as it avoids unnecessary comparisons, character by character. Instead, the hash value of the pattern is compared with the hash of the substring of the text string all at once. If the hash values are not matched, the pattern is moved one position, and so there is no need to compare all the characters of the pattern one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the concept that if the hash values of the two strings are equal, then it is assumed that both of these strings are also equal. The main problem with this algorithm is that there can be two different strings whose has values are equal. In that case, the algorithm may not work; this situation is known as a spurious hit. To avoid this problem, after matching the hash values of the pattern and the substring, we ensure that the pattern is actually matched by comparing them character by character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rabin-Karp pattern matching algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we preprocess the pattern before starting the search, that is, we compute the hash value of the pattern of length $m$ and the hash values of all the possible substrings of the text of length $m$. So, the total number of possible substrings would be $n-m+1$. Here, $n$ is the length of the text.\n",
    "2. We compare the hash value of the pattern and compare it with the hash value of the substrings of the text one by one.\n",
    "3. If the hash values are not matched, then we move the pattern by one position.\n",
    "4. If the hash value of the pattern and the hash value of the substring of the text matches, then we compare the pattern and substring character by character to ensure that the pattern is actually found in the text.\n",
    "5. We continue the process of streps 2 through 4 until we reach the end of the given text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, we can compute the numerical hash values using Homer's rule or any other hashing function that returns a unique value for the given string. We can also compute the hashing value using the sum of the ordinal values of all the characters of the string. Example on pages 293-294.\n",
    "### Implementing the Rabin-Karp algorithm\n",
    "The first step to implementing the Rabin-Karp algorithm is to choose the hash function. We use the sum of all the ordinal values of the characters of the string as the hashing function. We start by storing the ordinal values of all the characters of the text and the pattern. Next, we store the length of the text and the pattern in `len_text` and `len_pattern` variables. Next, we compute the hash value for the pattern by summing up the ordinal values of all the characters in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a variable called `len_hash_array` that stores the total number of possible substrings of length using `len_text - len_patttern + 1`, and we create an array called `hash_text` that stores the ahsh value for all the possible substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we start a loop that will run for all the possible substrings of the text. Initially, we compute the hash value for the first substring by summing the ordinal values of all of its characters using `sum(ord_text[:len_pattern])`. Furthermore, the hash values for all of the substrings are computed using the hash values of its previous substrings as `((hash_text[i-1] - ord_text[i-1]) + ord_text[i+len_pattern-1])`.\n",

The KMP algorithm is efficient as it minimizes the comparisons of the given patterns with respect to the text string. An example of the motivation behind the KMP algorithm works is on page 297.\n",

    "3. If there is a mismatch, then we assign the value of the precomputed `prefix` function for q to the index value of q.\n",
    "4. We continue searching the pattern in the text string until we reach the end of the text, that is, if we do not find any matches. If all of the characters in the pattern are matched in the text string, we return the position where the pattern is matched in the text and continue to search for another match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is on pages 301-303. It takes the space and time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, and further, in the second phase, that searching, the KMP algorithm takes time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",

    "### Boyer-Moore algorithm\n",
    "As we have already discussed, the main objective of the string pattern matching algorithm is to find ways of skipping comparisons as much as possible by avoiding unnecessary comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithm is another such algorithm (apart from the KMP algorithm) that further improves the performance of pattern matching by skipping some comparisons. You need to understand the following concepts to be able to use the Boyer-Moore algorithm:\n",
    "1. In this algorithm, we shift the pattern in the direction from left to right, similar to the KMP algorithm\n",
    "2. We compare the characters of the pattern and the text string from the right to the left direction, which is opposite of the KMP algorithm.\n",
    "3. The algorithm skips unnecessary comparisons by using the good-suffix and bad-character shifts concept\n",
    "### Understanding the Boyer-Moore algorithm\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore algorithm compates the pattern over the text from right to left. If uses the information of the various possible alignments in the pattern by preprocessing it. The main idea of this algorithm is that we compare the end characters of the pattern with the text. If they do not match, then the pattern can be moved on further. If the characters do not match in the end, there is no need to do further comparisons. In addition, in this algorithm, we can also see what portion of the pattern has matched, so we utilize this information and align the text and pattern by skipping any unnecessary comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore algorithm has two heuristics to determine the maximum shift possible for the pattern when we find a mismatch:\n",
    "- bad character heuristic\n",
    "- good suffix heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of a mismatch, each of these heuristics suggests possible shifts, and the Boyer-Moore algorithm shifts the pattern by considering the maximum shift possible due to bad character and good suffix heuristics. The details of the bad character and good suffix heuristics are explained in detail with examples in the following subsections.\n",
    "### Bad character heuristic\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore algorithm compates the pattern and text string in the direction from right to left. It uses the bad character heuristic to shift the pattern. According to the bad character shift concept, if there is a mismatch between the character of the pattern and the text, then we check if the mismatched character of the text occurs in the pattern or not. If this mismatched character (aka a bad character) does not appear in the pattern, then the pattern will be shifted to this character, and if that character appears somewhere in the pattern, we shift the pattern to align with the occurence that character with the bad character of the text string. Examples of the bad character heuristic are shown on pages 306-308.\n",
    "### Good suffix heuristic\n",
    "The bad character heuristic does not always provide good suggestions. The Boyer-Morre algorithm also uses the good suffix heuristic as well to shift the pattern over the text string to find the location of the matched patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good suffix heuristic is based on the matched suffix. Here, we shift the pattern to the right in such a way that the matched suffix subpattern is aligned with another occurrence of the same suffix in the pattern. It works like this: we start by comparing the pattern and the text string from right to left. If we find any mismatch, then we check the occurrence of the suffix that we have matched so far. This is known as the good suffix. We shift the pattern in such a way that we align another occurrence of the good suffix to the text. The good suffix heuristic has two main cases:\n",
    "1. The matching suffix has one or more occurrences in the pattern.\n",
    "2. Some part of the matching is present in the start of the pattern, meaning that the suffix of the matched suffix exists as the prefix of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book uses the same examples to explain the good suffix heuristic on pages 309-310. The Boyer-Moore algorithm has time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(m)$ for the preprocessing of the pattern, and further searching takes the time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$.\n",
    "### Implementing the Boyer-Moore algorithm\n",
    "Initially, we have the text string and the pattern. After initializing the variables, we start with a while loop that starts by comparing the last character of the pattern tot he corresponding chracter of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the characters are compared from right to left by the use of the nested loop from the last index of the pattern to the corresponding character of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the characters are compared from right to left by the use of the nested loop from the last index of the pattern to the first character of the pattern. This uses `range(len(pattern)-1, -1, -1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer while loop keeps track of the index in the text string while the inner for loop keeps track of the index position of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we start comparing the characters by using `pattern[j] != text[i+j]`. If they are mismatched, we make the flag variable `False`, denoting there is a mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we check if the good suffix is present or not by using the condition `j == len(pattern)-1`. If this condition is true, it means that there is no good suffix possible, so we check for the bad character heuristics, that is, if a mismatched character is present in the pattern or isn't using the condition `text[i+j] in pattern[0:j]`, and if the condition is true, then it means that the bad character is present in the pattern. In this case, we move the pattern to align this bad character to the other occurrence of this character in the pattern by using `i=i+j-pattern[0:j].rfind(text[i+j])`. Here, `i+j` is the index of the bad character.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the bad character is not present in the pattern, we move the whole pattern next to the mismatched character by using the index `i=i+j+1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we go into the `else` part of the condition to check the good suffix. When we find the mismatch, we further test to see whether we have any subpart of a good suffix present in the prefix of the pattern. We do this by using the following condition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text[i+j+k:i+len(pattern)] not in pattern[0:len(pattern)-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Furthermore, we check whether the length of the good suffix is 1 or not. If the length of the good suffix is 1, we do not consider this shift. If the good suffix is more than 1, we find the number of shifts by using the good suffix heuristics and store this in the `gsshift` varaible. This is the pattern to a position where the good suffix of a pattern matches with `pattern[0:len(pattern)-1].rfind(i+j+k:i+len(pattern)])`. Furthermore, we computed the number of shifts possible due to the bad character heuristic and stored in the `bcshift` variable. The number of shifts possible is `i+j-pattern[0:j].rfind(text[i+j])` when the bad character is present in the pattern, and the number of shifts possible would be `i+j+1` in the case of the bad character not being present in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we shift the pattern on the text string by the maximum number of moves given by a bad character and good suffix heuristics by using the instruction `i=max((bcshift, gsshift))`. Finally, we check whether the flag variable is `True` or not. If it is `True`, this means that the pattern has been found and that the matched index has been stored in the `matched_indices` variable.\n",
