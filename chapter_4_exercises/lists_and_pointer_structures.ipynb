    "## Lists and Pointer Structures\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "An **array** is a sequential list of data. Being sequential means that each element is stored right after the previous one in memory. If your array is really big and you are low on memory, it could be impossible to find large enough storage to fit your entire array. This will lead to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the flip side of the coin is that arrays are very fast. Since each element follows on from the previous one in memory, there is no need to jump arround between different memory locations. This can be a very important point to take into consideration when choosing between a list and an array in your own real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed arrays in chapter 2.\n",
    "### Pointer structures\n",
    "Contrary to arrays, pointer structures are lists of items that can be spread out in memory. This is because each item contains one or more links to other items in the structure. The types of these links are dependent on the type of structures we have. If we are dealing with linked lists, then we will have links to the next (and possibly previous) items in the structure. In the case of a tree, we have parent-child links as well as sibling links.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several benefits to pointer structures. First, they don't require sequential storage space. They can start small and grow arbitrarily Second, they can start small and grow arbitrarily as you add more nodes to the structure. However, this flexility in pointers comes at a cost. We need additional space to store the address. For example, if you have a list of integers, each node is going to take up space by storing an integer, as well as an additional integer for storing the pointer to the next node.\n",
    "### Nodes\n",
    "At the heart of lists is the the concept of a node."

    "Now you have three variables, each with a unique name, a type, and a value. At the moment, there is no way to show the relationships between these variables. Nodes allow us to show how these variables relate to each other. A node is a container of data, together with one or more links to other nodes. A link is a pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple type of node is one that has only a link next to the node. As we know about the pointers, the string is not actually stored in the node, but rather there is a pointer to the actual string. Consider the example in the following diagram, in which there are two nodes. The first node has a pointer to the string, `\"eggs\"`, stored in memory and another pointer that stores the address of another node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the storage requirement for this simple node is two memory addresses. The data attributes of the nodes are pointers to the strings `\"eggs\"` and `\"ham\"`.\n",
    "### Finding endpoints\n",
    "We have created three nodes-one containing `\"eggs\"`, one `\"ham\"`, and another `\"spam\"`. The `\"eggs\"` node points to the `\"ham\"` node, which in turns points to the `\"spam\"` node. But what does the `\"spam\"` node point to? Since this is the last element in the list, we need to make sure its next member has a value that makes this clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we make the last element point to nothing, then we make this fact clear. In Python, we will use the special value `None` to denote nothing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to go from node `A` to node `B`, but at the same time we may need to move `B` to `A`. In that case, we add a `previous` pointer in addition to the next pointer. It is also important to note that the `next` pointer to `B`is `None`, and the `previous` pointer in node `A` is also `None`-that is to indicate that we have reached the boundary of our list at both endpoints. The first node `A`'s previous pointer points to `None` since it has no predecessor, just as the last item `B`'s `next` pointer points to `None` because it has no successor node.\n",

    "There is a big problem with the append method in the previous section: it has to traverse the entire list to find the insertion point. This may not be a problem when there are just a few items in the list, but it will be a big problem when the list is long, as we would need to traverse the whole list to add an item every time. Each append will be slightly slower than the previous one. The current implementation for the append operation is slowed down by $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, which is not desirable in the case of a long list.\n",

The worst-case running time of the append operation is now reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. All we have to do is make sure the previous last node points to the new node that is about to be appended to the list."

    "### Doubly linked lists\n",
    "We have discussed the singly linked list and the important opeartion that can be performed on it. Now, we will focus on the topic of a doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **doubly linked list** is quite similar to the singly linked list in the sense that we use the same fundamental concept of string nodes together, as we did in a singly linked list. The only difference between the two is that *in a singly linked list, there is only one link between each successive node, whereas, in a doubly linked list, we ahve two pointers-a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node in a singly linked list can only determine the next node associated with it. However, there is no way or link to go back from this referenced node. The direction of flow is only one way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a doubly linked list, we can solve this issue and include the ability not only to reference the previous node. Consider the following example diagram to understand the nature of the linkages between two successive nodes. With the existence of two pointers that point to the next and previous nodes, doubly linked lists become equipped with certain capabilities. Doubly linked lists can be traversed in any direction. A node in a doubly linked list can be easily referred to its previous node whenever required without having a variable to keep track of that node. However, in a singly linked list, it may be difficult to move back to the start or beginning of the list in order to make some changes at the start of the list, which is very easy now in the case of a doubly linked list.\n",
    "### A doubly linked list node\n",
    "The Python code to create a doubly linked list node includes its initializing methods, the `previous` point, the `next` pointer, and the `data` instance variables. When When a node is newly created, all these variables default is `None`. **See code after this section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `previous` variable has a reference to the previous node, while the `next` variable keeps the reference to the next node, and the `data` variable stores the data.\n",
    "### Doubly linked list class\n",
    "The doubly linked list class captures the data on which our functions will be operating. For the `size` method, we set the count instance variable to `0`; it can be used to keep track of the number of items in the linked list. `head` and `tail` will point to the head and tail of the list when we begin to insert nodes into the list. **See code after this section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubly linked lists also require functionalities that return the size of the list, insert items into the list, and also delete nodes from the list. We will be discussing and providing important functionalities and code on the doubly linked list in the following subsections.\n",
    "### Append\n",
    "The `append` operation is used to add an element at the end of a list. It is important to check whether the `head` of the list is `None`. If it is `None`, it means that the list is empty, or else the list has some nodes and a new node will be appended to the list. If a new node is to be added to the empty list, it should have the `head` pointing to the newly created node, and the tail of the list should also point at this newly created node through `head`. By the end of this series of steps, the head and tail will now be pointing to the same node. **See code after section to see append code operation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` part of the `append()` code is for adding a node to the empty node; the `else` part of the preceding program will be executed if the list is not empty. If the new node is to be added to a list, the new node's previous variable is set to the tail of the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    new_node.previous = self.tail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tail's next pointer (or variable) has to be set to the new node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    self.tail.next = new_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we update the tail pointer to point to the new node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    self.tail = new_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an append operation increases the number of nodes by one, we increase the counter by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    self.count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### The delete operation\n",
    "The deletion operation is easier in the doubly linked list compared to the singly linked list. Unlike a singly linked list, where we needed to keep track of the previously encountered node any time we traverse the whole length of the list, the doubly linked list avoids that whole step. This is made possible by the use of the previous pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delete` operation in a doubly linked list can encounter the following four scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The search item to be deleted is not found in the list\n",
    "- The search item to be deleted is located at the start of the list\n",
    "- The search item to be deleted is found at the tail end of the list\n",
    "- The search item to be deleted is located in the middle of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "The node to be deleted is identified by matching the data instance variable with the data that is passed to the method. If the data matches the data variable of a node, that matching node will be deleted. **See code following this section.**"

    "Finally, the `node_delete` variable is then checked to find out if a node is actually deleted or not. If any node is deleted, then we decrease the count variable by `1`, and this keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list:\n",

    "### List search\n",
    "The search for an item in a doubly linked list is similar to the way we did it in the singly linked list. We use the `iter()` method to check the data in all the nodes. As we run a loop through all the data in the list, each node is matched with the data passed in the `contain` method. If we find the item in the list, `True` is returned, denoting that the item is found, otherwise `False` is returned, which means the item was not found in the list. **See previous code cell.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The append operation in a doubly linked list has running time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and the delete operation has the complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "### Circular lists\n",
    "A circular linked list is a special case of a linked list. In a circular linked list, the endpoints are connected to each other. It means that the last node in the list points back to the first node. In other words, we can say that in circular linked lists all the nodes point to the next node and there is no end node, thus no node will point to `None`. Circular lists can be based on both singly and doubly linked lists. In the case of a doubly linked circular list, the first node points back to the last node and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows the concept of the circular linked list based on a doubly linked list where the last node is connected to the first node and vice versa. Here, we are going to look at an implementation of a singly linked circular list. It should be straightforward to implement a doubly linked circular list once we understand the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reuse the node class that we created in the subsection-singly linked lists. As a matter of fact, we can reuse most parts of the `SinglyLinkedList` class as well.\n",
    "### Appending elements\n",
    "To append an element to the circular list in a singly linked list, we have to just include new functionality so that the newly added appended node points back to the `tail` node.\n",
    "### Deleting an element in a circular list\n",
    "To delete a node in a circular list, it looks like we can do it similarly to how we did in the case of the append operation-simply make sure that `head` points to the `tail`. There is just a single line that needs to change in the delete operation. It is only when we remove the `tail` node that we need to make sure that the `head` node is updated to point to the new tail node.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a serious problem with this code. In the case of a circular list, we cannot loop until `current` becomes `None`, since the current node will never point to the `None` in case of circular linked lists. If you delete an existing node, you won't see this, but try deleting a nonexistent node and you will get stuck in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus need to find a different way to control the `while` loop. We cannot check whether `current` has reached `head`, because then it will never check the last node. But we could use `previous`, since it lags behind `current` by one node. However, there is a special case. The very first loop iteration, `current` and `previous` will point to the same node, namely the tail node. We want to ensure that the loop runs here since we need to take the one node list into consideration.\n",
    "### Iterating through a circular list\n",
    "To traverse the circular linked list, it is very convenient as we don;t need to look for the starting point. We can start anywehre, and we just need to carefully stop traversing when we reach the same node agin. We can use the same `iter()` method, which we discussed earlier. It should work fo rour circular list; the only difference is that we have to mention an exit conditon when we are iterating through the circular list, or otherwise the program will get stuck in a loop and it will run indefinitely. We can make an exit condition by using th ecounter variable."
