    "There are three Python data type categories:\n",
    "- numeric\n",
    "- sequence\n",
    "- mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the `None` object that represents `Null`, i.e. the absence of a balue. It should not be forgotten that other objects such as classes, files, and exceptions can also properly be considered *types*; however, they will not be considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value in Python has a data type. Unlike many programming languages, in Python you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. Python keeps track of object types internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Name | Description |\n",
    "| :------- | :--- | :---------- |\n",
    "| None | `None` | It is a null object. |\n",
    "| Numeric | `int` | This is an integer data type. |\n",
    "| Numeric | `float` | This data type can store a floating-point number. |\n",
    "| Numeric | `complex` | It stores a complex number. |\n",
    "| Numeric | `bool` | It is Boolean type and returns `True` or `False`. |\n",
    "| Sequences | `str` | It is used to store a string of characters. |\n",
    "| Sequences | `list` | It can store a list of arbitrary objects. |\n",
    "| Sequences | `tuple` | It can store a group of arbitrary items. |\n",
    "| Sequences | `range` | It is used to create a range of integers. |\n",
    "| Mapping | `dict` | It is a dictionary data type that stores data in *key, value* pairs. |\n",
    "| Mapping | `set` | It is a mutable and unordered collection of unique items. |\n",
    "| Mapping | `frozenset` | It is an immutable set. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### None type\n",
    "The `None` type is immutable. It is used `None` to show the absence of a value; it is similar `null` in many programming languages, such as C and C++. Objects return `None` when there is actually nothing to return. It is also returned by `False` Boolean expressions. `None` is often used as a default value in function arguments to detect whether a function call has passed a value or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric types\n",
    "Number types are described above.  Python provides the `int` data type that allows standard arithmetic operators to work on them, similar to other programming languages. A Boolean data type has two possible values, `True` and `False`. These values are mapped to `1` and `0`, respectively."

Tuples are very useful when we want to set up multiple variables in one line, or to allow a function to return multiple values of different objects. Tuple is an ordered sequence of items similar to the `list` data type. Tuples are indexed by integers greater than zero. Tuples are **hashable**, which means we can sort lists of them and they can be used as keys to dictionaries.\n",

    "We can also create a tuple using the built-in function: `tuple()`. With no argument, this creates an empty tuple. If the argument to `tuple()` is a sequence then this creates a tuple of elements of that sequence. It is important to remember to use a trailing comma when creating a typle with one element-without the trailing comma, this will be interpreted as a string. An important use of tuples is to allow us to assign more than one variable at a time by placing a tuple on the left-hand side of an assignment."

    "### Beginning with dictionaries\n",
    "In Python, the `Dictionary` data typle is one of the most popular and useful data types. A dictionary stores the data in a mapping of key and value pair. Dictionaries are mainly a collection of objects; they are indexed by numbers, strings, or any other immutable objects. Keys should be unique in the dictionaries; however, the values in the dictionary can be changed. Python dictionaries are the only built-in mapping type; they can be thought of as a mapping from a set of keys to a set of values. They are created using the `{key:value}` syntax. For example, the following code can be used to create a dictionary that maps words to numerals using different methods:"

When we use the in operator on a list, the relationship between the time it takes to find an elementand the size of the list is considered linear. That is, as the size of the list gets bigger, the corresponding time it takes to find an element grows, at most, linearly. The relationship between the time an algorithm takes to run compared to the size of its input is often referred to as its time complexity. We will talk more about this important topic in the next few chapters.\n",

They are often described by the term **Abstracted Data Types (ADTs)**. ADTs can be considered mathematical specifications for the set of operations that can be performed on data. They are defined by their behavior rather than their implementation. In addition to the ADTs that we have looked at, there are several Python libraries that provide extensions to the built-in datatypes. These will be discussed in the following section.\n",
    "### Collections\n",
    "The `collections` module provides move specialized, high-performance alternatives for the built-in data types as well as a utility function to create named tuples. The following table lists the datatypes and operations of the collections module and their descriptions:\n",

    "| `UserDict`, `UserList`, `UserString` | These three data types are simply wrappers for their <br> underlying base classes.

For example, `dq[1:2]` results in a `TypeError`.\n",

Deques are thread-safe and can be serialized using the `pickle` module.\n",
