    "In linear data structures, data items are stored in a sequential order, one after another, whereas nonlinear data structures store data items in a non-linear order, where a data item can be connected to more than one data item. All of the data items in the linear data structures can be traversed in one pass, whereas this is not possible in the case of a non-linear data structure. The trees are the non-linear data structure; they store the data differently from other linear data structures such as *arrays*, *lists*, *stacks*, and *queues*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tree data structure, the nodes are arranged in a *parent-child* relationship. There should not be any cycle among the nodes in trees. The tree structure has nodes to form a hierarchy, and a tree that has no node is called an **empty tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree is a collection of nodes, where the nodes in the tree can have zero, one, or two child nodes. A simple binary tree has a maximum of two children. A tree is called a **full binary tree** if all the nodes of a binary tree have either zero or two children. A binary tree is called a **complete binary tree** if it is completely filled, with a possible exception at the bottom level, which is filled from left to right. The node class changes a bit from our previous structures:\n",

    "### Tree traversal\n",
    "The method to visit all the nodes in a tree is called **tree traversal**. This can be done either using the **depth-first search (DFS)** method or the **breadth-first search (BFS)** method.\n",
    "##### DFS\n",
    "Using the DFS, we traverse a tree starting from the root, and go deeper into the tree as much as possible on each child, and then continue to traverse to the next sibling. We use the recursive approach fpr tree traversal. There are three forms of depth-first traversal, namely, in-order, pre-order, and post-order.\n",
    "##### In-order traversal and infix notation\n",
    "In-order tree traversal works as follows. First, we check if the current node is null or empty. If it is not empty, we traverse the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start traversing the left sub-tree and call the `inorder` function recursively\n",
    "2. Next, we visit the root node\n",
    "3. Finally, we traverse the right sub-tree and call the `inorder` function recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inorder` function has the following implement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def inorder(self, root_node):\n",
    "    current = root_node\n",
    "    if current is None:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    self.inorder(current.left_child)\n",
    "    print(current.data)\n",
    "    self.inorder(current.right_child)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We visit the node by printing the visited node. In this case, we first recursively call the `inorder` function with `current.left_child`, then we visit the root node, and finally we recursively call the `inorder` function with `current.right_child` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **infix** notation (reverse Polish notation) is a commonly used notation to express arithmetic expressions where the operators are placed in-between the operands. It is common to use this way of representing an arithmetic expression since this is the way we are normally taught in schools. For example, the operator is inserted (infixed) between operands, as in `3 + 4`. When necessary, parentheses can be used to build a more complex expression, such as `(4 + 5) * (5 - 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expresstion tree is a special kind of **binary tree** that can be used to represent arithmetic expressions. This in-order traversal of an expression tree produce the infix notation. The in-order traversal of the preceding expression tree gives us the infix notation.\n",
    "### Pre-order traversal and prefix notation\n",
    "Pre-order tree traversal works as follows. First of all, we check if the current node is null or empty. If it is not empty, we traverse the tree. The pre-order tree traversal works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start traversing with the root node.\n",
    "2. Next, we traverse the left sub-tree and call the `preorder` function with the left sub-tree recursively.\n",
    "3. Next, we visit the right sub-tree and call the `preorder` function with the right sub-tree recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to traverse a tree in pre-order mode, we visit the tree in the order of root node, the left sub-tree, and the right sub-tree node. The recursive function for the `preorder` tree traversal is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def preorder(self, root_node):\n",
    "    current = root_node\n",
    "    if current is None:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    print(current.data)\n",
    "    self.preorder(current.left_child)\n",
    "    self.preorder(current.right_child)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Post-order traversal and postfix notation\n",
    "`postorder` tree traversal works as follows. First of all, we check if the current node is null or empty. If it is not empty, we traverse the tree. `postorder` tree traversal works as follows:\n",
    "1. We start traversing the left sub-tree and call the `postorder` function recursively.\n",
    "2. Next, we traverse the right sub-tree and call the `postorder` function recursively.\n",
    "3. Finally, we visit the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the implementation of the `postorder` method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def postorder(self, root_node):\n",
    "    current = root_node\n",
    "    if current is None:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    self.postorder(current.left_child)\n",
    "    self.postorder(current.right_child)\n",
    "    print(current.data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Postfix or **reverse Polish notation** places the operator after its operands, such as `3 4 +`. As in the case with Polish notation, there is no further confusion over the precedence of operators, so parentheses are never needed: `4 5 + 5 3 - +`.\n",
    "### Breadth-first traversal\n",
    "Breadth-first traversal starts from the root of the tree and then visits every node on the next level of the tree. Then, we move to the next level in the tree, and so on. This kind of tree traversal is breadth-first as it broadens the tree by traversing all the nodes in a level before going deep into the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode of traversal is implemented using a queue data structure. Starting with the root node, we push it into a queue. The node at the front of the queue is accessed (dequeued) and either printed or stored for later use. The left node is added to the queue followed by the right node. Since the queue is not empty, we repeat this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python implementation of this algorithm is implemented as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "class Tree:\n",
    "    def breadth_first_traversal(self):\n",
    "        list_of_nodes = []\n",
    "        traversal_queue = deque([self.root_node])\n",
    "```\n",
    "We enqueue the root node and keep a list of the visited nodes in the `list_of_nodes` list. The `dequeue` class is used to maintain a queue.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while len(traversal_queue) > 0:\n",
    "    node = traversal_queue.popleft()\n",
    "    list_of_nodes.append(node.data)\n",
    "    if node.left_child:\n",
    "        traversal_queue.append(node.left_child)\n",
    "    if node.right_child:\n",
    "        traversal_queue.append(node.right_child)\n",
    "# Return the list of nodes\n",
    "return list_of_nodes\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the number of elements in `traversal_queue` is greater than zero, the body of the loop is executed. The node at the front of the queue is popped off and appended to the `list_of_nodes` list. The first `if` statement will `enqueue` the left child node if the `node` provided with a left node exists. The second `if` statement does the same for the right child node. The `list_of_nodes` is returned in the last statement."

    "### Binary trees\n",
    "A binary tree is one in which each node has a maximum of two children. The nodes in the binary tree are organized in the form of left sub-tree and right sub-tree. If the tree has a root, $R$, and two sub-trees, that is, left sub-tree, $T_1$, and right sub-tree $T_2$, then their roots are called, `left successor` and `right successor`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular binary tree has no other rules as to how elements are arranged in the tree. It should only satisfy the condition that each node should have a maximum of two children.\n",
    "### Binary search trees\n",
    "A **binary search tree (BST)** is a special kind of binary tree. It is one of the most important and commonly used data structures in CS applications. A BST is a tree that is structurally a binary tree, and stores data in its nodes very efficiently. It provides very fast search operations, and other operations such as insertion and deletion are also very easy and convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree is called a binary search tree if the value at any node in the tree is greater than the values in all the nodes of its left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the values of nodes of the right sub-tree. For example, if $\\mathbb{K_1}$, $\\mathbb{K_2}$, and $\\mathbb{K_3}$ are key values in a tree of three nodes, then it should satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "1. The key values of $\\mathbf{K_2} \\leq \\mathbf{K_1}$\n",
    "2. The key values of $\\mathbf{K_3} > \\mathbf{K_1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a BST. In this tree, all of the nodes in the left sub-tree are less than or equal to the value of that node. Also, all of the nodes in the right sub-tree of this node are greater than that of the parent node. Testing our tree for the properties of a BST, we notice that all of the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node have a value less than 5. Likewise, all the nodes in the right sub-tree have a value that is greater than 5. This property applies to all the nodes in a BST, with no exceptions.\n",
    "### BST implementation\n",
    "Let's begin the implementation of a BST in Python. We need to keep track of the root node of the tree, so we start by creating a `Tree` class that holds a reference to the root node:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Tree:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.root_node = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's all that is needed to maintain the state of a tree. Let's example the main operations on the tree.\n",
    "### BST operations\n",
    "The operations that can be performed on a BST are `insert`, `delete`, `finding_min`, `finding_max`, `searching`, and so on.\n",
    "### Finding the minimum and maximum nodes\n",
    "The structure of the binary search tree makes searching a node that has a maximum or a minimum value very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a node that has the smallest value in the tree, we start traversal from the root of the tree and visit the left node each time until we reach the end of the tree. Similarly, we traverse the right sub-tree recursively until we reach the end to find the node with the biggest value in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python implementation of the method that returns the minimum node is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_min(self):\n",
    "    current = self.root_node\n",
    "    while current.left_child:\n",
    "        current = current.left_child\n",
    "        \n",
    "    return current\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Python implementation of the method that returns the maximum node is similar:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_max(self):\n",
    "    current = self.root_node\n",
    "    while current.right_child:\n",
    "        current = current.right_child\n",
    "        \n",
    "    return current\n",
    "```\n",
    "The running time complexity to find the minimum or maximum value in a BST is $\\mathcal{O}(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree.\n",
    "### Inserting nodes\n",
    "One of the most important operations to implement on a BST is to insert data items in the tree. As we have already discussed, regarding the properties of the BST, for each node in the tree, the left child nodes should contain the data less than their own value and the right child nodes should have data greater than their value. So, we have to ensure that the property of the BST satisfies whenever we insert an item the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example , let's create a BST by inserting data items **5**, **3**, **7**, and **1** in the tree. Consider the following:\n",
    "1. **Insert 5**: We start with the first data item, **5**. To do this, we will create a node with its data attribute set to **5**, since it is the first node.\n",
    "2. **Insert 3**: Now, we want to add the second node with value **3** so that data value **3** is compared with the existing node value, **5**, of the root node. Since the node value **3** is less than **5**, it will be placed in the left sub-tree of node **5**. The tree satisfies the BST rule.\n",
    "3. **Insert 7**: TO add another node of value **7** to the tree, we start from the root node with value **5** and make a comparison. Since **7** is greater than **5**, the node with value **7** is place to the right of this root.\n",
    "4. **Insert 1**: Let's add another node with value **1**. Starting from the root of the tree, we make a comparison between **1** and **5**. This comparison shows that **1** is less than **5**, so we go to the left node of **5**, which is the node with a value of **3**. When we compare **1** with **3**, since **1** is less than **3**, we move a level below node **3** to its left. However, there is no node there. Therefore, we create a node with the value **1** and associate it with the left pointer of node **3** to obtain the following structure. Here we have the final BST of 4 nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this example contains only integers or numbers. So, if we need to store the string data in the BST, in this case strings would be compared alphabetically. And, if we want to store our own custom data types inside a BST, we will have to make sure that our class supports ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python implementation of the `insert` method to add the nodes in the BST is given as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insert(self, data):\n",
    "    node = Node(data)\n",

    "                    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now let's try to understand each of the instructions of the `insert` function, step by step. We start with a function declaration:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insert(self, data):\n",
    "```\n",
    "By now, you will be used to the fact that we encapsulate the data in a node. This way, we hide away the `node` class from the client code, who only needs to deal with the tree:\n",

    "```\n",
    "A first check will be done to find out whether we have a root node. If we don't, the new node becomes the root node:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "````\n",

    "current = self.root_node\n",
    "parent = None\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    parent = current\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we must perform a comparison. If the data held in the new node is less than the data held in the current node, then we check whether the current node has a left child node. If it doesn't, this is where we insert the new node. Otherwise, we keep traversing:\n",

    "Another important operation on a BST is the `deletion` or `removal` of nodes. There are three scenarios that we need to cater for during this process. The node that we want to remove might have the following:\n",
    "- **No children**: If there is no leaf node, directly remove the node\n",
    "- **One child**: In this case, we swap the value of that node with its child, and then delete the node\n",
    "- **Two children**: In this case, we first find the in-order successor or predecessor, swap the value with it, and then delete the node\n",
    "\n",
    "The first scenario is the easiest to handle. If the node about to be removed has no children, we simply remove it from its parent. We have the case where the node we want to delete is a leaf, which is an easy deletion. However, if the node we wish to delete is a parent node of some sort, then it is a bit more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `Node` class does not hae a reference to a parent. As such, we need to use a helper method to `search` and return the node with its parent. This method is similar to the `search` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_node_with_parent(self, data):\n",
    "    parent = None\n",
    "    current = self.root_node\n",
    "    if current is None:\n",

    "    while True:\n",
    "        if current.data == data:\n",
    "            return(parent, current)\n",
    "        elif current.data > data:\n",
    "            parent = current\n",
    "            current = current.left_child\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            parent = current\n",
    "            current = current.right_child\n",
    "            \n",
    "    return(parent, current)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The only difference is that before we update the current variable inside the loop, we store its parent with `parent = current`. The method to do the actual removal of a node begins with this search:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def remove(self, data):\n",
    "    parent, node = self.get_node_with_parent(data)\n",

As long as a left node exists, `leftmost_node.left_child` will evaluate to `True` and the `while` loop will run.

    "### Benefits of a BST\n",
    "A binary search tree is a better choice compared to arrays and linked lists. A BST is fast for most operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion, whereas arrays provide fast searching, but are comparatively slow in insertion and deletion operations. In a similar fashion, linked lists are efficient in performing insertion and deletion operations, but are slower when performing the search operation. The best-case running time complexity for searching for an element from a binary search tree is $\\mathcal{O}(log(n))$, and the worst-case time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, whereas both best-case and wortst-case time complexity for searching in lists is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",

    "### Balancing trees\n",
    "We have seen in the previous section that if nodes are inserted into a tree in a sequential order, it becomes slow and behaves more or less like a list; that is, each node has exacity one child node. To improve performance of the tree data structure, we generally like to reduce the height of the tree as much as possible to balance the tree by filling up each row in the tree. This process is called **balancing the tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of self-balancing trees, such as red-black trees, AA trees, and scapegoat trees. These balance the tree during each operation that modifies the tree, such as insert or delete. There are also external algorithms that balance a tree. The benefits of these are that you don't need to balance the tree on every single operation and can leave balancing to the point where you need it.\n",
    "### Expression trees\n",
    "An arithmetic expression is represented by a combination of operators and operands where the operators can be unary or binary. An arithmetic expression can be also be represented using a **binary tree**, which is called an expression tree. This tree structure can be used to parse arithmetic and boolean expression. In an expression tree, all the leaf nodes contain the operands and non-leaf nodes contain the operators. We should also note that expression tree will have one of its sub-trees empty in the case of a unary operator. The arithmetic expression can be expressed using theee notations (infix, postfix, and prefix). Due to this, it becomes easy to evaluate an expression tree for the given arithmetic expression. The reverse Polish notation provides faster calculations. We will show you how to construct the expression tree for the given postfix notation in the following subsection.\n",
    "### Parsing a reverse Polish expression\n",
    "Now, we are going to build up a tree for an expression written in postfix notation. Then, we will calculate the result. We will use a simple implementation. To keep it simple, since we are going to grow the tree by merging smaller trees, we only need a tree node implementation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data = None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to build the tree, we are going to enlist the items with the help of a stack.Let's just create an arithmetic expression and set up our stack:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "expr = \"4 5 + 5 3 - *\".split()\n",
    "stack = Stack()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since Python is a language that tries hard to have sensible defaults, its `split()` method splits on whitespace by default. Each element of the `expr` list is going to be either an operator or an operand. If we get an operand, then we embed it in a tree node and push it onto the stack. If we get an operator, then we embed the operator into a tree node and pop its two operands into the node's left and right children. Here, we have to take care to ensure that the first pop goes into the right child; otherwise, we will have problems with subtraction and division.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for term in expr:\n",
    "    if term in \"+-*/\":\n",
    "        node = TreeNode(term)\n",
    "        node.right = stack.pop()\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        node = TreeNode(int(term))\n",
    "    stack.push(node)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that we perform a conversion from `string` to `int` in the case of an operand. You could use `float()` instead, if you wish to support floating point operands. At the end of this operation, we should have one single element in the stack, and that holds the full tree. If we want to evaluate the expression, we would build the following little function:\n",

    "A heap data structure is a specialization of a tree in which the nodes are ordered in a specific way. Heaps are divided into `max` heaps and `min` heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `max` heap, each parent node value must always be greater than or equal to its children. It follows that the root node must be the greatest value in the tree. Consider the following diagram for the max heap, where all the nodes have greater values compared to their children. In a `min` heap, each parent node must be less than or equal to both its children. As a consequence, the root node holds the lowest value. Consider the following diagram for the min heap, where all the nodes have smaller values compared to their children. Heaps are used for a number of different things. For one, they are used to implement priority queues. There is also a very efficient sorting algorithm, called **heap sort**, that uses heaps.\n",
