    "## Stacks and Queues\n",
    "A stack is a data structure that stores data, similar to a stack of plates in a kitchen. You can put a plate on top of the stack, and when you need a plate, you take it from the top of the stack. The last plate that was added to the stack will be the first to be picked from the stack. Similarly, a stack data structure allows us to store and read data from one end, and the element which is added last is picked up first (**LIFO structure**).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary operations that are performed on stacks-`push` and `pop`. When an element is added to the top of the stack, it is pushed onto the stack. When an element is to be picked up from the top of the stack, it is popped off the stack. Another operation that is used sometimes is `peek`, which makes it possible to see the element on top of the stack without popping it off.\n",

    "Stacks are used to:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It first pushes the address of the current instruction onto the stack, then jumps to the definition of `a`\n",
    "2. Inside function `a()`, the function `b()` is called\n",
    "3. And, the return address of the function `b()` is pushed onto the stack\n",
    "4. Once the exection of the instructions in `b()` and the function are complete, the return address is popped off the stack, which takes us back to function `a()`\n",
    "5. When all the instructions in function `a` are completed, the return address is again popped off from the stack, which takes us back to the `main` function and the `print` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are also used to pass data between functions. Consider the following example. Say you have the following function call somewhere in your code:\n",

    "### Stack implementation\n",
    "Stacks can be implemented in Python using node. We start by creating a `node` class, as we did in the last chapter regarding lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed, a node holds data and a reference to the next item in a list. Here, we are going to implement a stack instead of a list; however, the same principle of nodes works here-nodes are linked together through references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us look at the `stack` class. It starts off in a similar way to a singly linked list. We will need two things to implement a stack using nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first need to know which is at the top of the stack so that we will be able to apply the `push` and `pop` operations through this node.\n",
    "2. We would also like to keep track of the number of nodes in the stack, so we add a `size` variable to the stack class. Consider the following code snipet for the stack class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Stack:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.top = None\n",
    "        self.size = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Push operation\n",
    "The `push` operation is an important operation on a stack; it is used to add an element at the top of the stack. We implement the push functionality in Python to understand how it works. At first, we check if the stack already has some items in it or it is empty when we wish to add a new node in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stack already has some elements, then we have to do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The new node must have its next pointer pointing to the node that was at the top earlier.\n",
    "2. We put this new node at the top of the stack by pointing `self.top` to the newly added node.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the existing stack is empty, and the new node to be added is the first element, we need to make this node the top node of the element. Thus, `self.top` will point to this new node. The following is globally the complete implementation of the `push` operation in `stack`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def push(self, data):\n",
    "    node = Node(data)\n",
    "    if self.top:\n",
    "        node.next = self.top\n",
    "        self.top = node\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.top = node\n",
    "    self.size += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Pop operation\n",
    "Now, we need another important function of the stack, and that is the `pop` operation. It reads the topmost element of the stack and removes it from the stack. The `pop` operation returns the topmost ellement of the stack and returns `None` if the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the `pop` operation on a stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, check if the stack is empty. The pop operation is not allowed on an empty stack.\n",
    "2. If the stack is not empty, it can be checked if the top node has its **next** attribute pointing to some other node. It means the stack has elements, and the topmost node is pointing to the next node in the stack. To apply the `pop` operation, we have to change the top pointer. The next node should be at the top. We do this by pointing `self.top` to `self.top.next`.\n",
    "3. When there is only one node in the stack, the stack will be empty after the pop operation. We have to change the top pointer to `None`.\n",
    "4. Removing such a node results in `self.top` pointing to `None`.\n",
    "5. We also decrement the size of the stack by 1 if the stack is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pop(self):\n",
    "    if self.top:\n",
    "        data = self.top.data\n",
    "        self.size -= 1\n",
    "        if self.top.next:\n",
    "            self.top = self.top.next\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.top = None\n",
    "        return data\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Peek operation\n",
    "There is another important operation that can be applied on stacks-the `peek` method. This method returns the top element from the stack without deleting it from the stack. The only difference between `peek` and `pop` is that the `peek` method just returns the topmost element; however, in the case of a `pop` method, the topmost element is returned and also that element is deleted from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `peek` operation allows us to look at the top element without changing the stack. This method iws very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def peek(self):\n",
    "    if self.top:\n",
    "        return self.top.data\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Bracket-matching application\n",
    "Now let us look at an example application showing how we can use our stack implementation. We are going to write a little function that will verify whether a statement containing brackets-`(`, `[`, or `{`-is balanced, that is, whether the number of closing brackets matches the number of opening brackets. It will also ensure that one pair of brackets really is contained in another:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_brackets(statement):\n",
    "    stack = Stack()\n",
    "    for ch in statement:\n",
    "        if ch in ('(', '[', '{'):\n",
    "            stack.push(ch)\n",
    "        if ch in (')', ']', '}'):\n",
    "            last = stack.pop()\n",
    "            if last is '{' and ch is '}':\n",
    "                continue\n",
    "            elif last is '[' and ch is ']':\n",
    "                continue\n",
    "            elif last is '(' and ch is ')':\n",
    "                continue\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "    if stack.size > 0:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Our function parses each character in the statements passed to it. If it gets an open bracket it pushes it onto the stack. If it gets a closing bracket, it pops the top element of the stack and compares the two brackets to make sure their types match. If they don't we return `False`; otherwise, we continue parsing. We need to do one last check. If the stack is empty, then it is fine and we can return `True`. But if the stack is not empty, then we have an open bracket that does not have a matching closing bracket and we will return `False`. We can test our code below:"

An item added first will be read first, and adding an element to the queue is called `enqueue`. When we delete an element from the queue it is called the `dequeue` operation. Whenever an element is enqueued, the length or size of the queue increments by 1. Conversely, dequeuing  items reduces the number of elements in the queue by 1.\n",

    "### List-based queues\n",
    "Queues can be implemented using various methods such as `list`, `stack`, and `node`. We shall discuss the implementation of queues using all these methods. one by one. Let's start by implementing a queue using the `list` class. Operations will be encapsulated by the `ListQueue` class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ListQueue:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.items = []\n",
    "        self.size = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Enqueue operation\n",
    "The `enqueue` operation adds an item to the queue. It uses the `insert` method of the `list` class to insert items (or data) at the front of the list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def enqueue(self, data):\n",
    "    self.items.insert(0, data)    # Always insert items at index 0\n",
    "    self.size += 1                # Increment the size of the queue by 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note how we implement insertions in queues using list. The concept is that we add the items at index `0` in a list; it is the first position in an array or list. To make our queue reflect the addition of the new element, the size is increased by 1:\n",
    "### Dequeue operation\n",
    "The `dequeue` operation is used to delete items from the queue. This method returns the topmost item from the queue and deletes it from the queue.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dequeue(self):\n",
    "    data = self.items.pop()       # delete the topmost item from the queue using the pop method from list class\n",
    "    self.size -= 1                # decrement the size of the queue by 1\n",
    "    return data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, `pop()` from the list class deletes the last item from the list and returns the deleted item from the list back to the user or code that called it. Since queues use the FIFO system, this works just fine. Remember that the enqueue operation using these methods is slow, since we could potentially need to shift a very large amount of data by one index just to add the new set of data to the front of the list queue.\n",
    "### Stack-based queues\n",
    "Queues can also be implemented using two stacks. We initially set two instance variables to create an empty queue upon initialization. These are the stacks that will help us to implement a queue. The stacks, in this case, are simply Python lists that allow us to call `push` and `pop` methods on them, which eventually allow us to get the functionality of `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        self.inbound_stack = []\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inbound stack is only used to store elements that are added to the queue. No other operation can be performed on this stack.\n",
    "### Enqueue operation\n",
    "The `enqueue` method is to add items to the queue. This method is very simple and only receives the `data` to append to the queue. This data is then passed to the `append` method of the `inbound_stack` in the `queue` class. Furthermore, the `append` method is used to mimic the `push` opeartion, which pushes elements to the top of the stack.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def enqueue(self, data):\n",
    "    self.inbound_stack.append(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Dequeue operation\n",
    "The `dequeue` operation is used to delete the elements from the queue in the order of items added. New elements added to our queue end up in the `inbound_stack`. Instead of removing elements from the `inbound_stack`, we shift our attention to another stack, the `outbound_stack`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `outbound_stack` works as follows: we first check to see if it is empty or not. If it is empty, we move all the elements of the `inbound_stack` to the `outbound_stack` using the `pop` operation on the stack. Now the `inbound_stack` becomes empty and the `outbound_stack` keeps the elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if the `outbound_stack` is not empty, we proceed to remove the items from the queue using the `pop` operation.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dequeue(self):\n",
    "    if not self.outbound_stack:\n",
    "        while self.inbound_stack:\n",

    "    return self.outbound_stack.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement first checks whether the `outbound_stack` is empty or not. If it is not empty, we proceed to remove the the element at the front of the queue using the `pop` method (line 5). If the `outbound_sstack` is empty instead, all the elements in the `inbound_stack` are moved to the `outbound_stack` before the front element in the queue is popped out. The while loop will continue to be executed until all the elements in the `inbound_stack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self.inbound_stack.pop()` statement will remove the latest element that was added to the `inbound_stack` and immediately pass the popped data to the `self.outbound_stack.append()` method call."

    "### Node-based queues\n",
    "Using a Python list to implement a queue is a good start to get a feel for how queues work. It is also possible for us to implement our own queue data structrue by utilizing pointer structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue can be implemented using a doubly linked list, and `insertion` and `deletion` operations on this data structure, and that has a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. The definition for `Node` class remains as the `Node` when we discussed in doubly linked lists. A doubly linked list can be treated as a queue if it enables a FIFO kind of data access, where the first element added to the list is the first to be removed.\n",
    "### Queue class\n",
    "The `queue` class is very similar to that of the doubly linked `list` class the `node` class to adding a node in a doubly linked list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class node(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data = None, next = None, prev = None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = next\n",
    "        self.prev = prev\n",
    "        \n",
    "class queue:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "        self.tail = None\n",
    "        self.count = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the `self.head` and `self.tail` pointers are set to `None` upon creation of an instance of the `queue` class. To keep a count of the number of nodes in `queue`, the `count` instance variable is also maintained here and initially set to `0`.\n",
    "### The enqueue operation\n",
    "Elements are added to a `queue` object via the `enqueue` method. The elements or data are added through nodes. The `enqueue` method code is very similar to the `append` operation of the doubly linked list from the lists chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enqueue opeartion creates a node from the data passed to it and appends it to the `tail` of the queue, and points both `self.head` and `self.tail` to the newly created node if the queue is empty. The total count of elements in the queue is increased by the line `self.count += 1`. If the queue is not empty, the new node's previous variable is et to the tail of the list, and the tail's next pointer is set to the new node. Lastly, we update the tail pointer to point to the new node.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def enqueue(self, data):\n",
    "    new_node = node(data)\n",
    "    if self.head is None:\n",
    "        self.head = new_node\n",
    "        self.tail = self.head\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        new_node.prev = self.tail\n",
    "        self.tail.next = new_node\n",
    "        self.tail = new_node\n",
    "    self.count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### The dequeue operation\n",
    "The other operatin that makes our doubly linked list behave as a queue is the `dequeue` method. This method removes the node at the front of the queue. To remove the first element pointed to by `self.head`, an if statement is used:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dequeue(self):\n",
    "    current = self.head\n",
    "    if self.count == 1:\n",
    "        self.count -= 1\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "        self.tail = None\n",
    "    elif self.count > 1:\n",
    "        self.head = self.head.next\n",
    "        self.head.prev = None\n",
    "        self.count -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`current` is initialized by pointing it to `self.head`. If `self.count` is 1, then it means only one node is in the list and invariably the queue. Thus, to remove the associated node, the `self.head` and `self.tail` variables are set to `None`. If the queue has many nodes, then the head pointer is shifted to pointed to the next node after `self.head`. After the if statement is executed, the method returns the node that was pointed to by the `head`. Also, the variable `self.count` is decremented by 1 in both of these conditions, when the count is initially 1 and more than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember, the only things transforming the doubly linked list are the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods.*"

    "### Application of queues\n",
    "Queues can be used to implement a variety of functionalities in many real computer-based applications. For instance, instead of providing each computer on a network with its own printer, a network of computers can be made to share one printer by queuing what each printer wants to print. Operating systems also queue processes to be executed by the CPU.\n",

    "Most music player software allows users to add songs to a playlist. Upon hitting the play button, all the songs in the main playlist are played one after the other. Sequential playing of the songs can be implemented with queues because the first song to be queued is the first song to be played (FIFO).\n",

    "Each track holds a reference to the title of the song and also the length of the song. The length of the song is a random number between five and fifteen. The random module in Python provides the `randint` function to enable us to generate random numbers. The class represents any MP3 track or file that contains music. The random length of a track is used to simulate the number of seconds it takes to play a song or track. We create a few tracks:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A call is made to properly initialize the queue by making a call to `super`. This class is essentially a queue that holds a number of track objects in a queue. To add tracks to the queue, an `add_track` method is created:\n",

    "The `self.count` keeps count of when a track is added to our queue and when tracks have been dequeued. If the queue is not empty, a call to the `dequeue` method will return the node at the front of the queue. The `print` statement then accesses the title of the track through the `data` attribute of the node. To further simulate the playing of a track, the `time.sleep()` method halts program execution till the number of seconds for the track has elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
