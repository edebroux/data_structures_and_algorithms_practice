# data_structures_and_algorithms_practice
I never took a data structures and algorithms course while I was in college, as it was never a requirement for my coursework. I am currently working on filling in this gap in my education by working through hands-on examples, and I will also start going through more advanced exercises in the near future.

### Work as of 1/21/2021
All work to date includes Jupyter Notebook versions from Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python, Second Edition by Dr. Basant Agarwal and Benjamin Baka. Besides some grammatical corrections, all the work in this repository are only reproductions. In the future, there will be additional notes and exercises that include my own original work/solutions, but for now I am only producing these notebooks to expose myself to these concepts in data structures and algorithms.
