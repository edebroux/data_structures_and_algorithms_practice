    "# Sorting\n",
    "Sorting means arranging all the items in a list in ascending order of their magnitude. We will be discussing some of the most important sorting algorithms, which each have different performance attributes with respect to runtime complexity. Sorting algorithms are categorized by their memory usage, complexity, recursion, and whether they are comparison-based, among other considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the algorithms use more CPU use more CPU cycles, and, as such, have bad asymptotic values. Other algorithms chew on more memory and other computing resources as they sort a number of values. Another consideration is how sorting algorithms lend themselves to being expressed recursively, iteratively, or both. There are algorithms that use comparison as the basis for sorting elements. An example of this is the bubble sort algorithm. Examples of a non-comparison sorting algorithm are the bucket sort and pigeonhole sort algorithms.\n",
    "### Bubble sort algorithms\n",
    "The idea behind the bubble sort algorithm is very simple. Given an unordered list, we compare adjacent elements in the list, and after each comparison, place them in the right order of magnitude. This works by swapping adajacent items if they are not in the correct order. The process is repeated $n-1$ times for a list of $n$ items. In each such iteration, the largest element is arranged in the end. For example, in the first iteration, the largest element is arranged in the last position of the list, and again, the same process will be followed for the remaining $n-1$ items. In the second iteration, the second largest element will be placed at the second-to-last position in the list, and the process will then be repeated until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of the bubble sort algortihm starts with the swap method. The following code will swap the elements of `unordered_list[j]` with `unordered_list[j+1]` if they are not in the right order:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temp = unordered_list[j]\n",
    "unordered_list[j] = unordered_list[j+1]\n",
    "unordered_list[j+1] = temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "It should be simple to apply this concept to the entire list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for j in range(iteration_number):\n",
    "    if unordered_list[j] > unordered_list[j+1]:\n",
    "        temp = unordered_list[j]\n",
    "        unordered_list[j] = unordered_list[j+1]\n",
    "        unordered_list[j+1] = temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is important to know, when implementing a bubble sort algorithm, how many times the loop will need to run to complete all the swaps. To sort a list of three numbers, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`, we need to swap the elements  a maximum of two times. This is equal to the length of the list minus 1, and could be written as `iteration_number = len(unordered_list) - 1`. We subtract 1 because it gives us exactly the maximum number of iterations to run. Let's show this with the following example, where, in a list of 3 numbers, by swapping the adjacent elements in exactly two iterations, the largest number ends up at the last position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement makes sure that no unnecessary swaps occur if two adjacent elements are already in the right order. The inner `for` loop only causes the swapping of adjacent elements to occur exactly twice in our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many times does this swapping operation have to occur in order for the entire list to be sorted? We know that, if we repeat the whole process of swapping the adjacent elements a number of times, the listed will be sorted. An outer loop is used to make this happed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, both inner and outer loops have to run `len(unordered_list) - 1` times for all elements to be sorted:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bubble_sort(unordered_list):\n",
    "    iteration_number = len(unordered_list) - 1\n",
    "    for i in range(iteration_number):\n",
    "        for j in range(iteration_number):\n",
    "            if unordered_list[j] > unordered_list[j+1]:\n",
    "                temp = unordered_list[j]\n",
    "                unordered_list[j] = unordered_list[j+1]\n",
    "                unordered_list[j+1] = temp\n",
    "                \n",
    "    return unordered_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "The same principle is used even is used even if the list contains many elements. There are a lot of variations of the bubble sort, too, that minimize the number of iterations and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is a variant of the bubble sort algorithm where if there is no swapping within the inner loop, we simply quit the entire sorting process, because the absence of any swapping operation in the inner loop suggests that the list has already been sorted. In a way, this can help speed up the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bubble sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm that provides worst-case runtime complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, and a best-case complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Generally, the bubble sort algorithm should not be used to sort large lists. However, on relatively small lists, it performs fairly well.\n",
    "### Insertion sort algorithms\n",
    "The idea of swapping adjacent elements to sort a list of items can also be used to implement the insertion sort. An insertion sorting algorithm maintains a sub-list that is always sorted, while the other portion of the list remains unsorted. We take elements from the unsorted sub-list and insert them in the correct position in the sorted sub-list, in such a way that this sub-list remains sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In insertion sorting, we start with one element, assuming to be sorted, and then take another element from the unsorted sub-list and place it at the correct position in the sorted sub-list. This means that our sorted sub-list now has two elements. Then, we again take another element from the unsorted sub-list, and place it in the correct position in the sorted sub-list. We repeatedly follow this process to insert all the elements one by one from the unsorted sub-list into the sorted sub-list. The shaded elements denote the ordered sub-lists, and in each iteration, an element from the unordered sub-list is inserted at the correct position in the sorted sub-list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by using a `for` loop to run between the indicies 1 through n. We start from index 1 because we assume the sub-array at index 0 to already be in the correctly sorted order. At the start of the execution of the loop, we have the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for index in range(1, len(unsorted_list)):\n",
    "    search_index = index\n",
    "    insert_value = unsorted_list[index]\n",
    "```\n",
    "At the beginning of the execution of each run of the `for` loop, the element at `unsorted_list[index]` is stored in the `insert_value` variable. Later, when we find the appropriate position in the sorted portion of the list, `insert_value` will be stored at that index or location:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insertion_sort(unsorted_list):\n",
    "    for index in range(1, len(unsorted_list)):\n",
    "        search_index = index\n",
    "        insert_value = unsorted_list[index]\n",
    "\n",
    "        while search_index > 0 and unsorted_list[index-1] > insert_value:\n",
    "            unsorted_list[search_index] = unsorted_list[ssearch_index-1]\n",
    "            search_index -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        unsorted_list[search_index] = insert_value\n",
    "        \n",
    "    return unsorted_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `search_index` is used to provide information to the `while` loop; that is, exactly where to find the next element that needs to be inserted into the sorted sub-list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop traverses the list backward, guided by two conditions: first, if search_index > 0, then it means that there are more elements in the sorted portion of the list; second, for the `while` loop to run, `unsorted_list[search_index-1]` must be greater than the `insert_value` variable. The `unsorted_list[search_index-1]` array will do either of the following things:\n",
    "- Point to the element, just before the `unsorted_list[search_index]`, before the `while` loop is executed the first time\n",
    "- Point to one element before `unsorted_list[search_index-1]` after the `while` loop has been run the first time\n",
    "\n",
    "In the body of the while loop, the element at `unsorted_list[search_index-1]` is stored at `unsorted_list[search_index]`. `search_index -= 1` moves the list traversal backward until it holds a value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insertion sorting algorithm is considered stable, in the sense that it does not change the relative order of elements that have equal keys. It also only requires no more memory than that consumed by the list, because it does the swapping in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sorting algorithm gives a worst-case runtime complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, and a best-case complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "### Selection sort algorithm\n",
    "Another popular sorting algorithm is the selection sort. The selection sorting algorithm begins by finding the smallest element in the list, and interchanges it with the data stored at the first position in the list. Thus, it makes the sub-list sorted up to the first element. Next, the second smallest element, which is the smallest element in the remaining list, is identified and interchaged with the second position in the list. This makes the initial two elements sorted. The process is repeated, and the smallest element remaining in the list should be swapped with the element in the third index on the list. This means that the first three elements are now sorted. This process is repeated for $n-1$ times to sort $n$ items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm. The argument to the function is the unsorted list of items we want to put in ascending order of magnitude:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def selection_sort(unsorted_list):\n",
    "    size = len(unsorted_list)\n",
    "    for i in range(size):\n",
    "        for j in range(i+1, size):\n",
    "            if unsorted_list[j] < unsorted_list[i]:\n",
    "                temp = unsorted_list[i]\n",
    "                unsorted_list[i] = unsorted_list[j]\n",
    "                unsorted_list[j] = temp\n",
    "    return unsorted_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "The algorithm begins by using the outer `for` loop to go through the list, `size`, a number of times. Because we pass `size` to the `range` method, it will produce a sequence from zero to the `size-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner loop is responsible for going through the list and swap elements if we encounter an element less than an element less than the element pointed to by `unsorted_list[i]`. Notice that the inner loop begins from `i+1` up to `size-1`. The selection sorting algorithm gives worst-case and best-case runtime complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.\n",
    "### Quick sort algorithms\n",
    "The quick sort algorithm is very efficient for sorting. The quick sort algorithm falls under the divide and conquer class of algirhtms, similar to the merge sort algorithm, where we break (divide) a problem into smaller chunks that are much simpler to solve.\n",
    "### List partitioning\n",
    "The concept behind quick sorting is partitioning a given list or array. To partition the list, we first select a pivot. All the elements in the list will be compared with this pivot. At the end of the partitioning process, all elements that are less than the pivot will be to the left of the pivot, while all elements greater than the pivot will lie to the right of the pivot in the array.\n",
    "### Pivot selection\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we will take the first element in an array as the pivot. This kind of pivot selection degrades in performance, especially when sorting an already sorted list. Randomly picking the middle or last element in the array as the pivot does not improve the pivot and find the smallest element in a list in the next chapter.\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The partitioning step is very important in understanding the implementation of the quick sort algorithm,, so we will start with an examination of implementing the partitioning first. Let's look at another example to understand the implementation. Consider the following list of integers: `[43, 3, 20, 89, 4, 77]`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def partition(unsorted_array, first_index, last_index):\n",
    "    pivot = unsorted_array[first_index]\n",
    "    pivot_index = first_index\n",
    "    index_of_last_element = last_index\n",
    "    less_than_pivot_index = index_of_last_element\n",
    "    greater_than_pivot_index = first_index + 1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The partition function receives, as its parameters, the indices of the first and last elements of the array that we need to partition. The value of the pivot is stored in the `pivot` variable, while its index is stored in `pivot_index`. We are not using `unsorted_array[0]`, because when the unsorted array parameter is called with a segment of an array parameter is called with a segement of an array, index 0 will not necessarily point to the first element in that array. The index of the next element to the pivot, that is, the **left pointer**, `first_index+1`, marks the position where we begin to look for an element in the array that is greater than the `pivot`, as `greater_than_pivot_index = first_index + 1`. The **right pointer** `less_than_pivot_index` variable points to the position of the last element in the `less_than_pivot_index = index_of_last_element` list, where begin the search for the element that is less than the pivot:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    while unsorted_array[greater_than_pivot_index] < pivot and greater_than_pivot_index < last_index:\n",
    "        greater_than_pivot_index += 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "    while unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index] > pivot and less_than_pivot_index >= first_index:\n",
    "        less_than_pivot_index -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first inner `while` loop moves one index to the right until it lands on index 2, because the value at that index is greater than 43. At this point, the first `while` loop breaks and does not continue. At each test the condition in the first `while` loop, `greater_than_pivot_index += 1` is evaluated only if the `while` loop's test condition evaluates to `True`. This makes the search for an element, greater than the pivot, progress to the next element on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second inner `while` loop moves one index at a time to the left, until it lands on index 5, whose value, 20, is less than 43. At this point, neither `while` loop can be executed any further:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if greater_than_pivot_index < less_than_pivot_index:\n",
    "    temp = unsorted_array[greater_than_pivot_index]\n",
    "    unsorted_array[greater_than_pivot_index] = unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index]\n",
    "    unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index] = temp\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    break\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since `greater_than_pivot_index < less_than_pivot_index`, the body of the `if`  statement swaps the element at those indices. The `else` condition breaks the infinite loop any time `greater_than_pivot_index` becomes greater than `less_than_pivot_index`. In such a condition, it means that `greater_than_pivot_index` and `less_than_pivot_index` have crossed over each other. the `break` statement is executed when `less_than_pivot_index` is equal to 3 and `greater_than_pivot_index` is equal to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as we exit the `while` loop, we interchange the element at `unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index]` with that of `less_than_pivot_index`, which is returned as the index of the pivot:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "unsorted_array[pivot_index] = unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index]\n",
    "unsorted_array[less_than_pivot_index] = pivot\n",
    "return less_than_pivot_index\n",
    "```\n",
    "The mainbody of the main `quick_sort` function is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quick_sort(unsorted_array, first, last):\n",
    "    if last - first <= 0:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        partition_point = partition(unsorted_array, first, last)\n",
    "        quick_sort(unsorted_array, first, partition_point - 1)\n",
    "        quick_sort(unsorted_array, partition_point + 1, last)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `quick_sort` function is a very simple method, taking up no more than size lines of code. The heavy lifting is done by the `partition` function. When the `partition` method is called, it returns the partition point. This is the point in the `unsorted_array` array where all elements to the left are less than the pivot value, and all elements to its right are greater than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quicksort algorithm, the partition algorithm takes $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. As the quicksort algorithm follows the *divide and conquer* paradigm, it takes $\\mathcal{O}(log(n))$ time; therefore, the overall average-case runtime complexity of the quicksort algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(nlog(n))$. The quicksort algorithm gives a worst-case complexity for the quicksort algorithm would be when it selects the worst pivot point every time, and one of the partitions always has a single element. For example, if the list is already sorted, the worst-case complexity would occur if the partition picks the smallest element as a pivot point. When worst-case complexity would occur if the partitiion picks the algorithm can be improved by using the randomized quicksort. The quicksort algorithm is very efficient when sorting large amounts of data compared to the other aforementioned algorithms for sorting.\n",
    "### Heap sorting algorithms\n",
    "Our implementation always made sure that, after an element had been removed or added to a heap, the heap order property  was maintained, by using the `sink()` and `arrange()` helper methods. The heap data structure can be used to implement a sorting algorithm called the heap sort. As a recap, let's create a simple heap with the following items:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h = Heap()\n",
    "unsorted_list = [8, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 10, 7, 9, 6]\n",
    "for i in unsorted_list:\n",
    "    h.insert(i)\n",
    "print(\"Unsorted list: ()\".format(unsorted_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `heap_sort` method is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Heap:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def heap_sort(self):\n",
    "        sorted_list = []\n",
    "        for node in range(self.size):\n",
    "            n = self.pop()\n",
    "            sorted_list.append(n)\n",
    "            \n",
    "        return sorted_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `for` loop simply calls the `pop` method `self.size` number of times. Now, the `sorted_list` will contain a sorted list of items after the loop terminates. The `insert` method is called $n$ number of times. Together with the `arrange()` method, the `insert` operation takes a worst-case runtime of $\\mathcal{O}(nlog(n))$, as does the `pop` method. As such, this sorting algorithm incurs a worst-case runtime $\\mathcal{O}(nlog(n))$."
